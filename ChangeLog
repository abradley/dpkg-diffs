    - Revert "Some of the Debian system do not have 'aptitude' installed, but"
    
    - Some of the Debian system do not have 'aptitude' installed, but have 'apt' installed.  Make this script work with either.
    
    - Not all cases of invalid CLI options are being handled.  Add '*' to the case block.  (shellcheck SC2220)
    
    - Append additional handler to 'cd ...' with exit 1 (shellcheck SC2164)
    
    - Clarify the logic to ensure that it is not ambiguous.  (shellcheck SC2186)
    
    - 'read' mangles '/' so add an '-r' options to compensate for this.  (shellcheck SC2162)
    
    - If the script name has a space, compensate for this by adding quotes around the '$0'.
    
    - If the filename in a package has a space, compensate for this quirk by adding quotes around variables containing its blank-inserted filename.
    
    - Clarify logic to ensure that it is not ambiguous (shellcheck)
    
    - Add a shellcheck exemption requested for 'ls -A' which is immensely preferable over 'find $tempDir -type f'
    
    - Removed trailing spaces
